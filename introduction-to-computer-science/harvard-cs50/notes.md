# Harvard - CS50

CS50 is the introduction course for computer science students. Originally I wasn't really planning to take it as I'm kinda in an akward position. On the one hand I've been programming quite long and have been working in the Game Industry as a programmer since about 2 year. On the other hand I'm determined to retouch my basics to build myself up from the bottom up. The reason for doing so is that i believe that I come from a non-traditional computer science background and would like to formalise it more in order to make sure that I'm having the right foundations. Missing these fundamentals clearly shows when I fail a simple coding test, while applying for a company.

Therefore it is in my best interest not to skip any course and just go with the flow. It will however allow me to go really quickly through the lectures of courses like this but I should at least go through them. In this document I'll collect my notes and thoughts on the course.

# Week 0 + 1

The first 2 weeks were about kicking the course of with a bang. And seriously, they seem to really do a complete performance during those lectures. With prizes, guest speakers, video's, and what not. It's really fancy and way bigger than I ever got educated, hehe. I suppose it's not a bad way to try to make learning fun, as it should be after all.

Scratch was firstly introduced and later (week 1) the knowledge that was build in scratch (week 0) got transferred to C. They used a lot of side-by-side comparisons on how it is quite similar, and that it all is not that scary, which is true in a sense. It's all still quite high level, but they touch more core knowledge here and there. There is the quick introduction to command line, make, clang, processes, threads, binary, decimal, bytes, bits and algorithms.

In week 1 C got introduced. Students learned the syntax, but it was all still quite high level, especially as a small cs50 module was used to hide gore details such as char pointers to represent strings. A lot of I/O behaviour was also abstracted a way so that students can easily ask a string or number from the user and get it back. There was also a quick and high level overview on the compilation process, practically shown via Clang.

There was some quick command-line fu but nothing fancy and more just core basics. So far so good, and perhaps boring. However I do enjoy the lessons as they are presented in quite a fun way and they have a lot of extra's that make it still worthwhile watching. I do however look forward to the excercices, and hope that the hacker challenges allow me to go as far as I want.
