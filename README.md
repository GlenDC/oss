# Open Source Society

This is my personal repository as part of my journey as a student of the "Open Source Society".
It will contain my notes, thoughts, files and more, related to the courses I take as part of this journey.

In order to give myself a better change of succeeding I'm limiting the amount of _OSS_ courses I take to 1. I do however not really limit the amount of coursework I do at once. I should however be careful to not do to much work at once, reducing the change of dispair?!

You can find more information about OSS at: [https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science).

I do have to warn that I'm making this repository mainly for myself. It serves as a backup, but also just as a nice collection of reflections that should help me give a deeper understanding of the subject knowledge. You are however free to send pull requests with fixes for my mistakes, in case that keeps you up at night.

## Name Convention

To give this repository some consistency I'm naming the directories and files in this repositoris according to the following principle:

+ No capitals, and words are seperated by a dash `-` (`U+002D`)
+ A suffix to describe the category of file
  + `nat`: Stands for **N**otes **A**nd **T**houghts. This is porbably just a giant document, with some summaries of the content I learn in the course, combinded with reflections and rambling thoughts.
  + `sol`: Stands for **Sol**ution. This is a solution to a problem that I'm allowed to share according to the rules of the course.
  + `pap`: Stands for **Pap**per. This is an essay or paper I wrote as part of my coursework.
