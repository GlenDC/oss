# learn how to learn

As part of my journey on getting my fundamentals right I wanted to follow this course, after getting a recommendation about this course from OSS as a preperation for its curriculum. I was pleasently surprised that Barbara is one of the tutors. I knew her story from a TD talk she gave where she talked about her late entrance in the world of mathematics and engineering, after hating it for most of her life. It was quite easy for me to relate to what she was saying. So with that motivation being given, it's time to dive in.

## Week 1

A big topic this week was "Focussed Vs. Diffused Thinking". I do have to note that this course is mostly about learning how to learn and thus all the more scientific underlayings are quite simplified.

> Focussed thinking is used when you concentrate on something and thus focus. It narrows your vision and is for example used to solve issues with familiarities.

> Diffuse mode can be reached when doing something else, such as a physical activity (e.g. running, sporting, a shower, ...). In this case you are not focussed on anything in particular, maening that new ideas and concepts can bounce of more easily. This is very powerfull as it means that you can find problems to (new and) difficult solutions.

> You are either in diffused mode, or focussed mode, you can't be in both at once. It can however be quite helpful to switch between the 2 on purpose. You could for example work on an issue focussed, but then get stuck on a difficult probleem. Moving on to somthing trivial to move into diffuse mode, will help your ideas to form better as it will reach more places, and thus relate quicker to concepts you already know. People such as Dali and T. Edisson were quite good at this.

> All in all this course is mostly about learning more deeply and effectively. Having an understanding of our brains, with concepts such as "Diffuse Vs. Focussed".

> According to the course, we associate stuff we don't want to do to painfull experiences. So the trick is to move on to more pleasent tasks so that you avoid the painfull assocasions. This should somehow make you associate that activity with joyfull experiences and thus make eyou less likely to procastinate.

> Another trick we learned, was about allocating 25 minutes of time. Before doing so you remove all things that might distract you. Once your finished with your 25 minutes of work, you should than reward yourself. This routine/trick has a name, but who cares about such details... 

Synopses grow when we learn new stuff, and practice makes them stronger. Also remember that when practicing it's important to space out sessions rather than cramping them into a small time-span. This is very similar to how you would train your muscles in th Gym.

This also means that these Synopsees and neurons never stop growing, no mather how old we are. They do shrink and get worse, but practice and use of your brains kinda help you fight that. Oh yeah, simplifications and such. Also: Practice makes permanent.

> For the sake of this course, there are 2 typs of memory. Long term memory and working memory (which apperently happens in your prefrontal context).

> Our working memory can hold approx. 4 slots at the same time (debunking the older believe of 7+/- slots).

> Our long term memory can be compared to a large storage warehouse, and has a lot of space. Memoris do tend to overlap each other and it can therefore be tricky to find memories back. In order to get knowledge here you need practice, and the more practice, the easier it will be to find it back.

> Lastly, sleeping is very important. It has 2 functions. Firstly it cleans the toxics that collect over the course of our day in our brain. And secondly it ordens our memories. It removes the useless ones, and strethens and stores the important ones. Focussing on the stuff you want to remember right before you sleep, boosts its changes of survival, according to the course.

> Being smart helps, but isn't the golden recipe to success. Passion and persistance however is. (more or less)

All in all, this first week was very interesting. It was already quite insightfull, and I bought Barbara's book, so that I can read it over the course of the next weeks.

## Week 2

Recalling was a big topic this week. We learned for example that it isn't very useful to learn by reading your theory over and over again. Instead it is more useful to read it and than try to recall what you just read and what it was about. This is also a much better way at this point than making a diagram on paper to find the relationship between the different elements you just learned. The reason for this being that you're still developing the initial knowledge pilars and aren't ready yet to make connections between them.

Funny of that was all that I recalled after following this week in a rather distracting environment, so redoing week #2 was the only sane way to progress.

Rewatching the first part of week made me realize that it was mostly about chunking and recalling was just part of the process. A chunk is the result of forming connections between concepts and ideas you learn. This is quite handy as we can only hold about 4 items in our active memory as seen earlier. When learning you can actively focus on forming chunks. Skipping quickly through a chapter before reading it decently for example allows you to form ideas of the stuff you'll be learning, giving you the mental anchors you can use during the actual in-depth learning. Once you form those chunks it's important to also learn to place them into context. Here it's all about learning to know when to apply which tool. Learning in different environments can also help as it allows you decouple the location from the actual knowledge. Finally as I discussed earlier recalling has significant benifits.

Also not to forget is that in a lot of cases it's also important that you practice a concept yourself. This can be done by doing excicercices, reflecting/recalling what you have learned or simply practice testing yourself.

We also learned about the illusion of knowledge. This is when you fool yourslf that you know something by reading something in a book or by searching it on the internet. This makes you think you master a subject, while in fact you don't. It's also important to also look at a big picture view as it allows you to relate between different fields, even cross-field.

## Week 3

Week 3 was learning about procastination and how to tame it.

Procastination happens in 4 steps:

   1. _cue_: the environment/mood/situation/action/timing that triggers the habbit
   2. _routine_: the actual action of the habbit
   3. _reward_: the reward you give yourself after the routine has been completed (can be unconciousnes)
   4. _belief_: the reality you belief in

It was also said that procastination is very much related to addiction, in the sense that you look for quick rewards that make you happy now, but make it worse in the long-term. Luckily for us we can actually change our habbits and thus tame our procastinations.

The challenge is that procastination often happens below our concisiouness. The trick is to become aware of it and recognizing the cue. One common cue is that you focuss on the _Product_. So let's say that you have a task to clean the house, the product is that you have well... a clean house. This is painful as it will make you judge the cleaning while you do it and even in your mind before you start. You can see how painfull that looks. So instead you should focus on the _Process_ in which you just use something like the pomadora timer and you just go with the flow of, ah I'll clean the house for 25 minutes today. Once you do that you might realize that your done before the timer is even over.

Another mistake could be that you let yourself get distracted, isolating yourself locational or by using a proper headset with music can help with that. Once your in that routine because of your focus on the process you need to make sure to reward yourself at the end so that this new good habbit can be established within yourself. Your belief will be affected as you realize that you can do it if you just put time in it.

By creating good habbits (which require a little willpower, although not very much thanks to focus on process rather than product) you'll start harnassing your zombie-mode. Excecuting habbits in zombie-mode are automatic and rely therefore not on willpower to do something.

So to sum up, target your bad habbits, create good habbits and reward yourself enough and sufficient!
